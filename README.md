Nashville Software School Data Analytics Capstone
Analyze historical data and player stats to attempt to predict tournament winners
 
Motivation/Data Question
Over the pandemic, the sport of disc golf exploded. Where there was once 1 news outlet, there are now many. A person could spend hours on YouTube watching live and pre-recorded broadcasts of tournaments, with and without commentary. As an avid participant, I want to adapt my love of the sport into a data based hobby.

The main question I will attempt to answer is this- “Who is going to win the 2023 Pro Tour?”

The biggest contributors to the disc golf data world are UDisc (udisc.com) and Statmando (statmando.com). Udisc provides a convenient way to follow tournaments as they progress as well as look at past tournaments. Statmando is the all in one source for every pro level player’s stats. What I aim to create is the best of both worlds. An all in one tool that aggregates past tournament performance as well as player stats.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Using a web scraper, my goal is to pull  historical tournament data from Udisc and player data from Statmando to create a dashboard to review past performance and tournament data to identify any trends in stats that may indicate improvement, or possibly even decline. The apply this in an attempt to predict the winner of an upcoming tournament
